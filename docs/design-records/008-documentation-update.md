# 008: Documentation Update - Aligning with Tool-Based Architecture

## Status

Completed

## Context

The project documentation needed comprehensive updates to reflect recent architectural changes, particularly:
1. The move to a tool-based approach in DiagramAgent
2. RAG integration for code-aware generation
3. Storage and history management features
4. Updated UI components and flows

## Decision

Update all documentation to accurately reflect the current implementation:

1. **API Documentation**
   - Updated reference.md with current endpoints
   - Revised architecture.md with tool-based approach
   - Added RAG and storage flows
   - Updated sequence and component diagrams

2. **Project Structure**
   - Updated README.md with new features
   - Expanded project structure documentation
   - Updated requirements and dependencies
   - Added RAG-specific requirements

3. **Process Documentation**
   - Updated build-and-release.md
   - Added database setup procedures
   - Added RAG verification steps
   - Updated port numbers and paths

4. **UI/UX Documentation**
   - Updated frontend-setup.md
   - Added new component documentation
   - Updated styling guidelines
   - Added status indicator specifications

5. **Diagrams**
   - Updated class diagrams with new components
   - Added RAG sequence flows
   - Updated UI data flows
   - Revised user journey

## Changes Made

### 1. API Documents
- Added new endpoints for history management
- Updated request/response models
- Added RAG configuration options
- Updated error handling documentation

### 2. Architecture Documents
- Added tool-based component diagrams
- Updated generation flow sequences
- Added storage integration diagrams
- Added RAG processing flows

### 3. Implementation Guides
- Added SQLite database conventions
- Added RAG setup instructions
- Updated build process
- Added verification steps

### 4. Frontend Documentation
- Updated component structure
- Added context documentation
- Updated styling guidelines
- Added status indicators

### 5. Technical Diagrams
- Updated class relationships
- Added validation loops
- Added history management
- Added RAG interactions

## Consequences

### Positive
- Documentation now matches implementation
- Clear explanation of tool-based approach
- Better onboarding for new developers
- Comprehensive setup instructions

### Negative
- More documentation to maintain
- More complex architecture diagrams
- More setup steps for developers

## Follow-up Tasks

1. Keep documentation in sync with changes
2. Add more examples for RAG usage
3. Consider adding troubleshooting guides
4. Add performance optimization docs
